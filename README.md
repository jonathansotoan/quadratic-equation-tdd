# Quadratic Equation TDD
TDD example for training purposes. Example solves the classic quadratic equation (This example takes into account neither complex numbers nor very large numbers for simplicity purposes. See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticEquation.html for more information).

Master branch contains the starting point to develop with TDD methodologies, and the finished branch contains all the finished tests and the final implementation.

Feel free to make pull requests to finished branch if you implement another TDD (or unit testing) basic concept that should be included, and to master branch if there's something missing for the starting point.
