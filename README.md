# quadratic-equation-tdd
TDD example for training purposes. Example solves the classic quadratic equation (This example takes into account neither complex numbers nor very large numbers for simplicity purposes. See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticEquation.html for more information).

Feel free to make pull requests if you implement another TDD (or unit testing) basic concept that should be included.
